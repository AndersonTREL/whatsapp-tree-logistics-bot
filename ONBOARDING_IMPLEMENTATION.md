### **Complete User Journey:**
1. **Driver sends "Hello"** → Onboarding starts
2. **Bot asks for first name** → "What is your first name?"
3. **Driver provides first name** → "Thank you, [FirstName]! What is your last name?"
4. **Driver provides last name** → "Thank you, [FirstName] [LastName]! Which station do you work at? 1. DBE3 2. DBE2"
5. **Driver selects station** → "Perfect! Welcome [FullName] from [Station]! 🎉"
6. **Category menu appears** → Ready for requests with personalized greeting
