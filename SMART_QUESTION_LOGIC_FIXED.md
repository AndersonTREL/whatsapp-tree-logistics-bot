# 🎉 Smart Question Logic - Fixed!

## ✅ **AI NOW ASKS SENSIBLE QUESTIONS**

### **Problem: AI Asked Wrong Questions** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: AI was asking "Is it completely broken or still working a bit?" for SIM card issues, which doesn't make sense.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented smart question logic based on specific issue types
- Created category-specific follow-up questions
- Made AI understand different equipment issues

**Result**:
```
Before (Wrong):
User: "My SIM card doesn't work"
Bot: "Is it completely broken or still working a bit?" ❌

After (Correct):
User: "My SIM card doesn't work"
Bot: "Do you need a replacement SIM card or is it a technical issue?" ✅
```

## 🚀 **Smart Question Logic Implementation**

### **1. Equipment Category - Smart Questions**
```javascript
if (category === 'Equipment') {
  // SIM card issues
  if (messageLower.includes('sim') || messageLower.includes('card')) {
    followUpQuestion = 'Do you need a replacement SIM card or is it a technical issue?';
  }
  // Scanner issues
  else if (messageLower.includes('scanner')) {
    followUpQuestion = 'Is it completely broken or still working a bit?';
  }
  // Uniform issues
  else if (messageLower.includes('uniform') || messageLower.includes('clothes')) {
    followUpQuestion = 'What size uniform do you need?';
  }
  // Internet/network issues
  else if (messageLower.includes('internet') || messageLower.includes('network')) {
    followUpQuestion = 'What is your scanner phone number?';
  }
}
```

### **2. Initial Question Logic**
```javascript
// SIM card issues - ask for SIM card number and problem
if (messageLower.includes('sim') || messageLower.includes('card')) {
  smartQuestion = 'What is your SIM card number and what exactly is wrong with it?';
}
// Scanner issues - ask which part is broken
else if (messageLower.includes('scanner')) {
  smartQuestion = 'Which part of the scanner is broken? (e.g., screen, buttons, scanner gun, battery)';
}
// Uniform issues - ask what they need
else if (messageLower.includes('uniform') || messageLower.includes('clothes')) {
  smartQuestion = 'What type of uniform do you need?';
}
// Internet/network issues - ask for scanner phone number
else if (messageLower.includes('internet') || messageLower.includes('network')) {
  smartQuestion = 'What is your scanner phone number?';
}
```

## 📊 **Test Results**

### **✅ SIM Card Flow (Fixed)**
```

**✅ Questions make perfect sense for SIM cards!**

### **✅ Scanner Flow (Working)**
```
User: "My scanner is broken"
Bot: "Which part of the scanner is broken? (e.g., screen, buttons, scanner gun, battery)"

User: "The screen is cracked"

User: "Completely broken"
Bot: "Perfect! I've submitted your Equipment request. ✅"
```
