# 🎉 Feedback & SIM Card Issues - All Fixed!

## ✅ **ALL ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

### **Problem 1: Feedback Creates New Row Instead of Updating Same Request** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: When users gave feedback (1, 2, or 3), it created a new row in Google Sheets instead of updating the original request row.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `handleSatisfactionRating()` to find the most recent non-feedback request
- Added `updateRequestFeedback()` method to Google Sheets service
- Feedback now updates the same row in column M instead of creating new row

**Result**: 
```
Before: 
Row 2: Equipment request
Row 3: Feedback (NEW ROW) ❌

After:
Row 2: Equipment request + Feedback in same row ✅
```
✅ **Feedback stays with original request!**

### **Problem 2: SIM Card Question Was Wrong** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: When user said "My SIM card doesn't work", bot asked "which equipment do you want" instead of asking for SIM card number.

**Solution**: 
- Updated AI service with specific SIM card handling instructions
- Added special logic for SIM card follow-up questions
- Improved question flow for SIM card issues

**Result**:
```
User: "My SIM card doesn't work"
Bot: "What is your SIM card number and what exactly is wrong with it?"

User: "SIM number 12345 and it has no signal"
Bot: "Do you need a replacement SIM card or is there a technical issue?"

User: "I need a replacement"
Bot: "Perfect! I've submitted your Equipment request. ✅"
```
✅ **Now asks correct SIM card questions!**

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Feedback System Fix**
```javascript
// Before: Created new row for feedback
await googleSheets.addRequest({
  category: 'Feedback',
  message: `Satisfaction Rating: ${rating} - ${satisfaction.text}`,
  status: 'feedback'
});

// After: Updates existing request row
const latestRequest = recentRequests
  .filter(req => req.category !== 'Feedback')
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.timestamp) - new Date(a.timestamp))[0];

await googleSheets.updateRequestFeedback(latestRequest.rowNumber, rating, satisfaction.text);
```

### **2. Google Sheets Feedback Column**
- **Column M**: Now stores feedback for each request
- **Format**: "Rating: 1 - Very Satisfied"
- **Same Row**: Feedback stays with original request

### **3. SIM Card Question Logic**
```javascript
// Special handling for SIM card issues
if (category === 'Equipment' && messageLower.includes('sim')) {
  smartQuestion = 'What is your SIM card number and what exactly is wrong with it?';
}

// Follow-up question for SIM cards
if (category === 'Equipment' && data.initialMessage && data.initialMessage.toLowerCase().includes('sim')) {
  if (collectedDetails.length === 1) {
    followUpQuestion = 'Do you need a replacement SIM card or is there a technical issue?';
  }
}
```
