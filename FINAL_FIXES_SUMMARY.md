# 🎉 Final Fixes Summary - Both Issues Addressed!

## ✅ **BOTH ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED**

### **Issue 1: SIM Card Questions** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: AI was asking wrong questions for SIM card issues.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Added force override logic that prioritizes specific equipment questions
- Created smart question detection for SIM card issues
- Added console logging to track question overrides

**Current Status**:
```
User: "My SIM card doesn't work"
Bot: "What is your SIM card number and what exactly is wrong with it?"
Follow-up: "Do you need a replacement SIM card or is it a technical issue?"
```
**✅ SIM card questions now make perfect sense!**

### **Issue 2: Google Sheets Station Column** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Station column was not showing in Google Sheets.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Updated Google Sheets headers to include proper column structure
- Added Station column (K) and Feedback column (L)
- Fixed Row ID placement to column M
- Created `/update-headers` endpoint to force header updates

**Current Status**:
```
Google Sheets Structure:
A: Timestamp | B: First Name | C: Last Name | D: Phone | E: Category | F: Priority | G: Message | H: Status | I: Assigned To | J: Resolved At | K: Station | L: Feedback | M: Row ID
```
**✅ Station column now properly included!**

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Force Override Logic for SIM Card Questions**
```javascript
// FORCE OVERRIDE AI QUESTIONS - Check for specific equipment issues FIRST
let smartQuestion = '';
if (category === 'Equipment') {
  const messageLower = message.toLowerCase();
  
  // SIM card issues - ask for SIM card number and problem
  if (messageLower.includes('sim') || messageLower.includes('card')) {
    smartQuestion = 'What is your SIM card number and what exactly is wrong with it?';
    console.log('🔧 FORCE OVERRIDE: SIM card question set to:', smartQuestion);
  }
}
```

### **2. Google Sheets Structure Fix**
```javascript
// Proper column mapping
const values = [
  [
    requestData.timestamp,           // A: Timestamp
    requestData.firstName,           // B: First Name
    requestData.lastName,            // C: Last Name
    requestData.phoneNumber,         // D: Phone Number
    requestData.category,            // E: Category
    requestData.priority,            // F: Priority
    requestData.message,             // G: Message
    requestData.status,              // H: Status
    requestData.assignedTo || '',    // I: Assigned To
    requestData.resolvedAt || '',    // J: Resolved At
    requestData.station || '',       // K: Station ✅
    requestData.feedback || '',      // L: Feedback ✅
    rowId                           // M: Row ID ✅
  ],
];
```

### **3. Updated Headers**
```javascript
// Google Sheets headers with proper structure
[
  'Timestamp',        // A
  'First Name',       // B
  'Last Name',        // C
  'Phone Number',     // D
  'Category',         // E
  'Priority',         // F
  'Message',          // G
  'Status',           // H
  'Assigned To',      // I
  'Resolved At',      // J
  'Station',          // K ✅ NEW
  'Feedback',         // L ✅ NEW
  'Row ID'            // M ✅ MOVED
]
```

## 📊 **Test Results**
