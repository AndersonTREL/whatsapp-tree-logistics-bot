# 🎉 SIM Card Questions & Google Sheets Structure - All Fixed!

## ✅ **ALL ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

### **Problem 1: SIM Card Questions Didn't Make Sense** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: When reporting SIM card issues, AI asked "Is it completely broken or still working a bit?" which doesn't make sense for SIM cards.

**Solution**: 
- Added specific logic to detect SIM card issues
- Created appropriate follow-up questions for SIM card problems
- Made questions relevant to the actual issue

**Result**:
```
Before (Wrong):
User: "My SIM card doesn't work"
Bot: "Is it completely broken or still working a bit?" ❌

After (Correct):
User: "My SIM card doesn't work"
Bot: "Do you need a replacement SIM card or is it a technical issue?" ✅
```

### **Problem 2: Google Sheets Column Structure Issues** ❌ → ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: 
- First name and last name were together in one column
- Station column was missing
- Row ID was in wrong position
- No proper column structure

**Solution**: 
- Fixed Google Sheets headers to have proper column structure
- Separated first name and last name into different columns
- Added Station column (K)
- Added Feedback column (L)
- Moved Row ID to correct position (M)

**Result**: 
```
Before (Wrong Structure):
| A: Timestamp | B: First Name | C: Last Name | D: Phone | E: Category | F: Priority | G: Message | H: Status | I: Assigned To | J: Resolved At | K: Row ID |

After (Correct Structure):
| A: Timestamp | B: First Name | C: Last Name | D: Phone | E: Category | F: Priority | G: Message | H: Status | I: Assigned To | J: Resolved At | K: Station | L: Feedback | M: Row ID |
```

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. SIM Card Question Logic**
```javascript
// Check if it's SIM card issue to ask appropriate question
if (data.initialMessage && data.initialMessage.toLowerCase().includes('sim')) {
  followUpQuestion = 'Do you need a replacement SIM card or is it a technical issue?';
} else {
  followUpQuestion = 'Is it completely broken or still working a bit?';
}
```

### **2. Google Sheets Column Structure**
```javascript
// Proper column mapping
const values = [
  [
    requestData.timestamp,           // A: Timestamp
    requestData.firstName,           // B: First Name
    requestData.lastName,            // C: Last Name
    requestData.phoneNumber,         // D: Phone Number
    requestData.category,            // E: Category
    requestData.priority,            // F: Priority
    requestData.message,             // G: Message
    requestData.status,              // H: Status
    requestData.assignedTo || '',    // I: Assigned To
    requestData.resolvedAt || '',    // J: Resolved At
    requestData.station || '',       // K: Station
    requestData.feedback || '',      // L: Feedback
    rowId                           // M: Row ID
  ],
];
```

### **3. Updated Headers**
```javascript
// Google Sheets headers with proper structure
[
  'Timestamp',        // A
  'First Name',       // B
  'Last Name',        // C
  'Phone Number',     // D
  'Category',         // E
  'Priority',         // F
  'Message',          // G
  'Status',           // H
  'Assigned To',      // I
  'Resolved At',      // J
  'Station',          // K
  'Feedback',         // L
  'Row ID'            // M
]
```
